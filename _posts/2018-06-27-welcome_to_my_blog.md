> This chapter of my life is called "blogging".

Let me introduce myself.

I am Stefanos (I go by **Steve**), I come from Greece 🇬🇷 and I am a computer scientist 👨🏻‍💻.
I like coding, driving and travelling. I also like coffee 🥤, black iced [Frappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frapp%C3%A9_coffee) coffee.

Originally, I am from the beautiful city of Thessaloniki.
Previously, I have lived in Geneva, Switzerland, where I worked for [CERN](https://home.cern/), and in [Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), UK, where I studied.

My research interests 🎓 are focused on (distributed) **systems**, **data science** and **machine learning**.
Moreover, I am an advocate for **open-source** software and **privacy** issues. I also enjoy participating in **hackathons**.

Carpe diem until the next one,
